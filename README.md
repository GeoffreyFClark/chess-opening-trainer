# Chess Opening Trainer (in-progress)

Project inspired by a fellow pilot in my squadron who has an absolutely incredible repertoire of chess openings with knowledge extending into the dozens of moves. I looked for a chess opening trainer and noticed that most *show* the user openings and provide analysis, whereas I'm interested in a trainer that specifically *quizzes you* through a selected chess opening move-by-move. </br> </br> 
Example Use Case: You already know the ideas behind a given opening, but want to quickly refresh your memory on the first 25 optimal moves of its main line in a puzzle/quiz format of practice rather than being shown.
