# Chess Opening Trainer (in-progress)

Project inspired by a fellow pilot in my squadron who has an absolutely incredible repertoire of chess opening theory. I decided to look for a chess opening trained, but only found ones that show you openings along with analysis.

I'm interested in a trainer that quickly quizzes you through selected chess openings move-by-move, so I decided to make one.
