# Chess Opening Trainer (in-progress)

Project inspired by a fellow pilot in my squadron who has an absolutely incredible repertoire of chess opening theory. I decided to look for a chess opening trainer, but only found ones that *show you* openings and provide analysis.

Whereas I'm interested in a trainer that specifically *quizzes you* through selected chess openings move-by-move, so I decided to make one. </br> Example Use Case: You already know the ideas behind an opening, but want to refresh your memory on the first 25 optimal moves of an opening's main line via puzzle/quiz format practice rather than simply being shown.
